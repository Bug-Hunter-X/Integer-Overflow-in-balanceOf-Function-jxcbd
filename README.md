This repository demonstrates an integer overflow vulnerability in a Solidity smart contract's balanceOf function and its solution. The balanceOf function, as it's currently written, is susceptible to integer overflow if a user's balance exceeds the maximum value of uint256.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow attackers to manipulate the contract's state. The solution provided implements a SafeMath library to prevent integer overflows.
